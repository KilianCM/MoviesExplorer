## MoviesExplorer

University project during an iOS workshop.

MoviesExplorer is an iOS application on which you can browse movies lists sorted by categories. You can open the trailer on Youtube from the movie details page.

The app proposes also a map with movie theaters located near the user location. Clicking on a movie theater pin allows you to open the website.

#### [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

This project uses the API TheMovieDB to get movies list and details.
The API key is hard coded in the NetworkManager because this project is a learning project. You can create easily a free API key on TheMovieDB website.
